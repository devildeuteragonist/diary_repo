# memory_repo
lobcorp was the first thing ive seen to put the words 'memory' and 'repository' together in a way that was memorable and im going to kinda neglect how that phrase was used in the game and take those two words VERY LITERALLY

this is going to be my own personal diary of sorts keeping track of things that i found memorable throughout the day. my anjunabeats data project has been left on the back burner due to having tons of other nigh-unmanageable work, but i want to ~~-git~~ push myself to contribute to my personal space on github a little bit every day. every memory will be a new commit and i will probably hate myself for it, but maybe i'll get a little more used to bash ~~though to the dismay of firm believers in linux, i feel no need to be 'bourne again'~~

as i know this has potential to be part of a portfolio, i might tailor it to track my data science career journey, so the experiences written here will likely be more manicured than what i - or anyone else - experiences in reality.
