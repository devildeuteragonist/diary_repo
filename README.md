# memory_repo
this is going to be my own personal diary of sorts keeping track of things that i found memorable throughout my day. my anjunabeats data project has been left on the back burner due to having tons of other nigh-unmanageable work, but i want to ~~git~~ push myself to contribute to my personal space on github a little more consistently, and i thought a digital journal would be the way to do it. every memory will be a new commit (or a few commits) and i will probably hate myself for it, but maybe i'll get a little more used to bash. ~~i might 'bash' my head in~~

as i know this has potential to be part of a portfolio, i might curate it as a data-science-career-journey-tracker, and the experiences written here will likely be more manicured than what i - or anyone else - experience in reality. 

the name is a tongue-in-cheek reference to something - if you know, you know
