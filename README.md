# memory_repo
this is going to be my own personal diary of sorts keeping track of things that i found memorable throughout the day. my anjunabeats data project has been left on the back burner due to having tons of other nigh-unmanageable work, but i want to ~~git~~ push myself to contribute to my personal space on github a little bit every day. every memory will be a new commit and i will probably hate myself for it, but maybe i'll get a little more used to bash ~~though to the dismay of firm believers in linux, i feel no need to be 'bourne again'~~

as i know this has potential to be part of a portfolio, i might tailor it to track my data science career journey, so the experiences written here will likely be more manicured than what i - or anyone else - experience in reality. 

the name is a reference to something if you know you know
