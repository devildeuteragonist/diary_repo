First diary entry. 

Not sure where to begin.
It's three in the morning on a Friday night, and as I am zapped of energy due to university life's newest set of stressors, I don't feel much like saying anything. 
Perhaps it would be most productive to uplift myself by discussing today's positives: 
- I got samosas with mango lassi! 
- I enjoyed the afternoon talking to and studying with a good friend. 
- I got a cookie that was 'funfetti' flavoured (though I imagine confetti would not taste very good). 
- I spent a few minutes playing Canabalt. 

All of these things are mundane, I guess, but these small things make me happy despite how merciless my courseload has been.
